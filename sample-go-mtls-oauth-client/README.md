# sample-go-mtls-OAuth-client

This is a sample Go OAuth client using mTLS certificates for authentication with Cloudentityâ€™s Authorization Control Plane SaaS. Additionally, this example demonstrates 
using the Cloudentity Pyron API Gateway.

## Prerequisites

* Docker
* Golang

## To run the sample OAuth client requires two primary tasks and a third, optional, task:
1. [Prepare your Cloudentity SAAS workspace](#configure-cloudentity-saas-workspace)
2. [Run the sample OAuth client app](#build-and-run-the-go-OAuth-client-sample)

### Configure Cloudentity SAAS workspace to allow import of Workspace and Client app.
1. Sign in [Cloudentity](https://authz.cloudentity.io/)

2. Choose the System workspace workspace.

3. Go to "Applications" in the left side bar, then choose "Clients".

4. Choose "Create Application".

5. Create the service following the steps shown.
  * Choose "OAuth" tab.
  * Copy the Client ID and Client Secret (these will be used in step below). 
  * Scroll down and set "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" to "Client Secret Post"

6. Choose the "Scopes" tab and turn on `manage_configuration` in the "Management" section.

Your workspace is now prepared to import the sample Workspace and Client. 

### Build and run the Go OAuth client sample

1. Find your tenant name and tenant URL as shown.

2. Go to the .env file in the root directory.
3. Fill in the values shown below with your configuration tenant URL, configuration tenant, client ID, and client secret.

4. Run the command below in the terminal from the root of the Go sample repo.
```
make run-all
```
After successfully starting the application you will see the following console log:

```
Login endpoint available at: http://localhost:18888/login
```

4. Go to your account and verify that the MTLS OAuth Sample workspace has been imported. 
[<img src="https://github.com/cloudentity/ce-samples-mtls-demo/blob/incr-build/sample-go-mtls-oauth-client/img/imported.png?raw=true.png" width="400">]
5. Go to "Governance->Policies" on the left side menu and notice that a sample policy has been created. 
[<img src="https://github.com/cloudentity/ce-samples-mtls-demo/blob/incr-build/sample-go-mtls-oauth-client/img/policy.png?raw=true.png" width="400">]
6. Go to "Enforcement->APIS" on the left side menu and notice that the `/balance` endpoint is set to "Unrestricted". 
[<img src="https://github.com/cloudentity/ce-samples-mtls-demo/blob/incr-build/sample-go-mtls-oauth-client/img/unrestricted.png?raw=true.png" width="400">]
7. To enforce the policy that has been created, click on "Unrestricted" for the `/balance` endpoint and set to "sample-mtls-policy". You should see that the API endpoint is now protected as shown.

8. Now go to the URL displayed in the terminal and follow the prompts to log in. The user name for the sample Identity provider is `user` and the password is `user`.
[<img src="https://github.com/cloudentity/ce-samples-mtls-demo/blob/incr-build/sample-go-mtls-oauth-client/img/login.png?raw=true.png" width="400">]
9. After logging in, note the certificate hash `x5t#S256`.
[<img src="https://github.com/cloudentity/ce-samples-mtls-demo/blob/incr-build/sample-go-mtls-oauth-client/img/hash.png?raw=true.png" width="400">]
10. Finally, click the "Call Resource Server API" link to use the token to interact with the resource server.

Now if you enter an incorrect hash or omit the header you will fail the validation.
